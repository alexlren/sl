# SL

This program is a clone of the original [SL](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl).

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at all.

After installing the package, you should be able to type `sl` and at least see the following or a random animation:
